# LazyTimeTracker

The basic idea is to have a small program running locally where its easy to generate the necessary entries for tracking the work time. As I'm a very chaotic person I tend to forget to book my work time on a daily base. This tool should help me to archive the task through its availability on the taskbar and a very simplified interface.
I add my most common projects as configuration items in this tool and get reminded 2 times a day to add entries if i didn't do it already. At the end of the day, week or month, I can just export the entries and use it to fill my SAP worktime table.
